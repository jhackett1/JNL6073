      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>Whether or not they knew it at the time, the founders of Periscope, one of the world’s most popular live video apps, were motivated by a journalistic instinct. In 2013, Kayvon Beykpour was passing through Istanbul when the Gezi Park protests broke out. He read about the protests on Twitter, but couldn’t see them.</p>

      <p>Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have been used as publishing platforms for citizen journalists ever since their inception, but improvements in network bandwidth and camera hardware mean that it’s now possible to capture and transmit video in real-time using a smartphone.</p>

      <p>Periscope now boasts an audience of over ten million, with over forty years of video being watched every day. A good fraction of Periscope’s content <a target="blank" href="http://mediashift.org/2015/04/periscope-meerkat-and-the-journalism-of-now/">is journalistic</a>. There are other live video apps available, but Periscope has the biggest market share thanks to its ownership by Twitter.</p>

      <p>In April 2015, days after the Periscope app launched, professional journalists and citizens were already fulfilling Beykpour’s vision, using it to cover civil unrest in Baltimore, in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray in police cusody.</p>

      </div>

      <p>More recently, reporters and documentarians working with the BBC’s <i>Panorama</i> used the app to broadcast first-hand the movement of people across Europe, at the height of the refugee crisis.</p>

      <h3>A new way of storytelling</h3>

      <p>Producer Ravin Sampat expressed a hope that the coverage demonstrated a “new way of storytelling”. The BBC has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/audiences/diverse_audiences.html" target="blank">struggled to engage younger audiences</a> for some time, and this campaign was not only journalism for its own sake, but a promotional tool for to engage underserved audiences with the concurrently filmed <i>Panorama</i> documentary.</p>

      <p>Reporter Paul Ronzheimer did something similar. He allowed Periscope audience members to put questions to his interviewees in real time. A Periscope user can interact with broadcasts by “hearting” them and contributing to a stream of real-time comments.</p>

      <p>Initially fearing that the unregulated forum would stoke up racist questioning, he instead found that the majority of questions were serious and born of genuine curiosity.</p>

      <p>Visual journalism, especially photojournalism and documentary production, plays on human empathy in a way that the written word struggles to. This pattern has been noted in social media too<sup>[<a href="#ref">1, 2</a>]</sup>. Could it be that live video, filmed solo and streamed globally, has the potential to go even deeper into our capacity for empathy?</p>

      <p>These uses of Periscope certainly fit into traditional criteria of journalism<sup>[<a href="#ref">3</a>]</sup>. It’s driven by new information and facts, and is imbued with a civic spirit and desire to expose the public to new perspectives in ways that mainstream media platforms could find difficult. Periscope <a target="blank" href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2015/11/18/periscope/">appears to actively encourage</a> the discovery of new international perspectives, via a “map view” that curates broadcasts across the globe.</p>

      <h3>An old medium</h3>

      <p>Livestreaming is old. Live online video dates back before the turn of the century, and the first popular turnkey service, Livestream.com, has been around since 2007. Tim Pool, one of the most well-known “new media” citizen journalists, used a smartphone and the Ustream service to cover the Occupy Wall Street protests back in 2011. His live videos were used as the basis of a great deal of other journalism, since police were making a conscious attempt to keep professional journalists away, and were even used as legal evidence.</p>

      <p>The fact that Periscope is bolted onto Twitter, the third most-used social network on the planet, is what makes it different. New Periscope users receive push notifications, are subtly encouraged to follow other Twitter users active on the platform, and to share their Periscope activity on Twitter. This integration means that Periscope has amassed millions of users in a fairly short time.</p>

      <p>The Twitter audience is interesting because, though not the largest of all the social networks, it has a well-documented degree of engagement and willingness to add to developing news<sup>[<a href="#ref">4, 5, 6</a>]</sup>. This is partially because of the highly public nature of the platform, along with the ease of search and availability of third-party tools (such as Tweetdeck) which make the work of the Twitter journalist easier. It is this audience which is being explicitly driven onto the Periscope platform.</p>

      <h3>Mobile-first</h3>

      <p>Periscope also differs from other more established livestreaming platforms in its mobile-only paradigm. Counter to the general trend toward polished, highly produced video content, Periscope only allows filming from a device’s internal camera, and broadcasts can (for now) only be viewed via the official app. Even normal landscape format video was disallowed until recently.</p>

      <p>This strategy has won it many users, and it could be argued that by consciously breaking free of traditional video paradigms and high production values, Periscope allows users to share something more immediate and personal, generally before an editorial line has even had time to form, linking back to the phenomenon observed by Paul Ronzheimer. It’s telling that when mainstream media organisations use Periscope, it tends to be via the personal accounts of journalists themselves. Though the platform is well-suited to reportage, it is comparatively rare for individuals to broadcast in the guise of organisations. Users expect to know exactly who is holding the camera.</p>

      <p>There is no way to connect to the Periscope servers from anything other than the official Periscope app, nor is there any way to edit video while it is being uploaded or afterward. This can be profoundly powerful. It is exceptionally difficult for a broadcaster to misrepresent where and when a broadcast was made, and it is very difficult to misrepresent the chronology of events. This leads to a streamlining of the usually substantial verification process<sup>[<a href="#ref">7</a>]</sup>.</p>

      <h3>The future</h3>

      <p>It’s clear that Periscope has the potential to be a journalistic tool quite unlike traditional TV broadcasting or more established online live streaming services. Periscope distils the strengths of older services such as those used by Tim Pool, and combines them with strong native audience interaction features. The encouragement of an active audience makes Periscope one more example of a journalistic platform redefining the old producer/consumer relationship<sup>[<a href="#ref">8</a>]</sup>.</p>

      <p>This aligns well with the founders' <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3?r=US&IR=T" target="blank">stated goals</a> of "spreading truth and empathy". Periscope’s leveraging of the news-savvy parts of Twitter’s audience means that it is well-poised to start delivering journalism with a human, authentic air that comes with the lack of production and editing inherent to live video. </p>
